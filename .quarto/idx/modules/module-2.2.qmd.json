A common sequence in data science is [group by()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html), [summarize()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) and [arrange()](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html). First, we group the data by certain value or category. Then we summarize it by applying a function like `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `median()` or `sd()`. Finally, we order the data according to column values. \n\nLet's go ahead and apply our three new verbs to a data frame and store the resulting new data frame in an object.  \n\nYou can download the raw data from [here](https://github.com/eteitelbaum/course-datasets/blob/main/dem_women.csv) and read it into your environment with the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package.
