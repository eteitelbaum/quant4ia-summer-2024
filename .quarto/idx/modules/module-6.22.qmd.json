Tables can be a great way to summarize data for your audience. While there are no hard and fast rules about when to use a table versus a plot, typically we use tables when we want to present summary statistics that we want to compare across groups or when we want to show the precise values for individual data points. This can be true when we have a small number of cases that we want to discuss. \n\nIn this module we are going to be working with the `tidycensus` package to download income data from the [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-tables.html) and the `kableExtra` and `gt` packages to visualize it. Along the way, we discuss \"the grammar of tables\" and some situations where a table would be less appropriate than other methods of visualizing our data.   \n\n## Working with tidycensus\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/_8lRlCA1kOQ title = 'Working with tidycensus'>}}\n\nWe are going to start by using `tidycensus` to download some income data. To use `tidycensus` you need a Census API key, which you can get [here](http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).   \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fake_setup\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(tidycensus)\ncensus_api_key(\"YOUR API KEY\") # enter your census api key here in quotes\n```\n\nUse the `load_variables()` function to import data from the census or ACS for a particular year. There is a `cache = TRUE` option if you want to cache the data for faster retrieval in the future. We can save our data in an object called `v21` and then click on it or use `View()` and the search function in the data frame viewer to see what data are available. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: load_vars\nv21 <- load_variables(2021, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE)\n\n#View(v21)\n```\n\nWe want data on income quintiles, so let's search for \"quintile\" in the search field. From there we use `get_acs()` to retrieve the data based on the codes for the five quintiles and the top five percent of earners. \n\nIn our call, we specify \"state\" as the geography and \"2021\" as the year. This will ensure that data from the 2017-2021 ACS is retrieved. Note that by default, tidycensus returns data such that rows represent a unit-variable combination. To get the data with census variables in the columns, we have to specify wide form with `output = \"wide\"`. We will select all of the variables except for the margin of error and GEOID. Let's rename NAME so it is in lower case. And for some reason, `tidycensus` puts an \"E\" suffix at the end of all of our variables when we specify wide format, so let's use `rename_with()` and `str_remove` from the [stringr] package to get rid of that suffix. We will save the data frame in an object called `quintiles`. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: get_data\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nquintiles <- get_acs(geography = \"state\", \n                      variables = c(q1 = \"B19081_001\",\n                                    q2 = \"B19081_002\",\n                                    q3 = \"B19081_003\",\n                                    q4 = \"B19081_004\",\n                                    q5 = \"B19081_005\",\n                                    top5 = \"B19081_006\"),\n                      year = 2021,\n                      output = \"wide\") |>\n                      select(\n                        !ends_with(\"M\"), # eliminate margin of error\n                        -GEOID) |> # eliminate geo id\n                      rename(name = NAME) |>\n                      rename_with(~str_remove(., 'E'))\n    \n\nglimpse(quintiles)\n```\n\n## Explore the data with kableExtra\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/JZLZHBqCbBk title = 'Explore Your Data with kableExtra'>}}\n\nNow let's use some `dplyr` [slice](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html) functions and `kableExtra` to subset and explore the data. First let's see which are the wealthiest states. To do this, we can apply `slice_max()` to identify the states with the highest incomes among the top 5 percent of wage earners. We will save that list as an object called `top_10` and then call `kable()` to view it. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: top10\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\ntop_10 <- quintiles |>\n  slice_max(top5, n = 10)\n\nkable(top_10)\n```\n\nNow let's do the same thing but searching for the poorest states instead. We will use the `slice_min()` function to identify the states with the lowest incomes in the first quintile of earners. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: bottom_10\n\nbottom_10 <- quintiles |>\n  slice_min(q1, n = 10)\n\nkable(bottom_10)\n```\n\nOK now let's make a table with a selection of states that reflects the full range of household incomes. So first, we will use `slice_min()` and `slice_max()` without arguments to select the state with the poorest households in `q1` and the state with the wealthiest households in `top5`. The we will use `slice_sample()` to take a random sample of five additional states. \n\nWe will store these selections in three objects and then combine them into a single data frame called `states` using the `dplyr` function [bind_rows](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind.html). `bind_rows()` appends data frames with different observations for the same set of columns. You can think of its a kind of \"verticle merging\" of data frames. \n\nAfter we have done the append, we can view the new data by calling `kable(states)`. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: mixed\n\n# lowest \nstate_min <- quintiles |> \n  slice_min(q1) \n\n# highest\nstate_max <- quintiles |> \n  slice_max(top5) \n\n# randomly select five more\nfive_more <- quintiles |>\n   slice_sample(n = 5) \n\nstates <- bind_rows(state_min, state_max, five_more) |>\n  arrange(desc(top5))\n\nkable(states)\n```\n\n## Display the data with a gt table\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/UoJm8_nFWsE title = 'Display Your Data with gt'>}}\n\nNow that we have some good data for a table, let's make a really beautiful table with the `gt` package. \"gt\" stands for \"grammar of tables.\" So just as we talked about a \"grammar of graphics\" when we were studying plots, we can talk about the “grammar of tables” and break a table down into its component parts. \n\n`gt` envisions six main parts of a table that can be customized in various ways. The table header includes the title and possibly a subtitle. Next, we have the stub section that contains our row labels and, above that, a stubhead label, which we could use to provide more information about what is in the rows. Then, we have column labels that tell us about what is in each column and the table body which contains the actual data that we want to present. Finally, we have the table footer, which would contain any notes that we have about information contained in the table as well as information about sources. Check out the `gt` [function reference](https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/) to get a sense of all the customizations available. \n\nLet's go ahead and start out by making a basic `gt` table with a title, subtitle, column labels, source note and format the numbers as dollar figures.\n\n### Make a good gt table \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(gt)\n\ngoodtable <- gt(states) |> \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Mean Household Income of Quintiles, 2021\",\n    subtitle = \"Seven Representative U.S. States\"\n  ) |> \n  cols_label(\n    name = \"\",\n    q1 = \"lowest\",\n    q2 = \"second\",\n    q3 = \"third\",\n    q4 = \"fourth\",\n    q5 = \"highest\",\n    top5 = \"top 5%\"\n  ) |> \n  fmt_currency(\n    columns = c(q1:top5),\n    currency = \"USD\", \n    use_subunits = FALSE\n  ) |>\n  # note that you can use markdown (md) to format the source note for html documents\n  tab_source_note(source_note = md(\"**Source**: US Census Bureau, American Community Survey\"))\n\ngoodtable\n```\n\n### Change column width\n\nNow let's add some further customization. One thing to pay attention to is the column width. Too narrow of columns can make it difficult to read the information, while too wide of columns can cause the table not to fit on the page. We can adjust the column width of our table with the `cols_width()` function.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: columnwidth\nvgoodtable <- goodtable |>\n  cols_width(c(q1:top5) ~ px(90))\n\nvgoodtable\n```\n\n### Change font\n\nNext we want to make sure that the fonts that we use are legible and accessible, just like we did for our charts. We can do this with `opt_table_font()`. \n\n```{r}\ngreattable <- vgoodtable |>\n  opt_table_font(font = \"verdana\")\n\ngreattable\n```\n\n### Center\n\nThen we want to check to make sure that information is aligned properly in the table. We can use right, left or center justify our text, depending on its purpose, by calling `cols_align()`. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: center\nvgreattable <- greattable |>\n  cols_align(\n  align = \"center\",\n  columns = q1:top5\n)\n\nvgreattable\n```\n\n### Add borders and lines\n\nFinally, we want to think about how to use borders and lines to separate and identify different elements of the table using `tab_options()` like this.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: nolines\nawesometable <- vgreattable |>\n  tab_options(\n    table.border.top.color = \"black\", \n    table.border.bottom.color = \"black\",\n    heading.border.bottom.color = \"black\", \n    column_labels.border.bottom.color = \"black\", \n    table_body.border.bottom.color = \"black\"\n  )\n\nawesometable\n```\n\n### Export your table\n\nNow try exporting your table as .png file with the `gtsave()` function. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: table_export\ngtsave(awesometable, \"awesometable.png\")\n```\n\n\n## When a plot is better than a table\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/kfGYwSnMTK8 title = 'When a Plot is Better than a Table'>}}\n\nBe judicious with your use of tables. You would not want to use tables where a plot is more appropriate. For example you would not want to use a table to show a trend over time (a line chart would be more appropriate) or to display the relationship between two variables (where a scatter plot would be more appropriate). \n\nAnother case where a table would be less effective than a plot is in showing estimates, margins of error and confidence intervals. Let's do an example with median income estimates. We can start by searching for \"median income\" and discover that the code for median income is B06011_001. Let's use that to extract the median income for counties in the state of Massachusetts.  \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nmass_med_inc <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\", \n  variables = c(median_income = \"B06011_001\"), \n  state = \"MA\", \n  year = 2021\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    lower_90 = estimate - moe,\n    upper_90 = estimate + moe \n  ) |>\n  clean_names() |>\n  mutate(name = str_replace_all(name, \" County, Massachusetts\", \"\")) |>\n  select(name, estimate, lower_90, upper_90)\n\nglimpse(mass_med_inc)\n```\n\nWe can select the county name, median income estimate and the upper and lower confidence intervals and put those in a table. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: bad_table\nkable(mass_med_inc)\n```\n\nBut this is not very compelling. So instead, we can plot confidence intervals with ggplot using a combination of `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_point()`. \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nmass_med_inc |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(name, estimate))) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower_90, xmax = upper_90)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Household income by county in Massachusetts\",\n       subtitle = \"2017-2021 American Community Survey\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"Median Income\", \n       caption = \"ACS estimate (bars represent 90% confidence intervals)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis conveys a lot more information relative to a table.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r}\n#| label: real_setup\n#| include: false\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nmy_api_key = Sys.getenv(\"census_api_key\")\ncensus_api_key(my_api_key)\n```\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Prework\n\n- Get a U.S. Census [api key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)\n- Install [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html) to retrieve the data we will use\n- Install [kableExtra](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) and [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/), out packages for making tables\n- install `webshot2` for exporting `gt` tables\n\n`install.packages(c(\"tidycensus\", \"kableExtra\", \"gt\", \"webshot2\"))`\n\n- We will be using the [stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/) package, which is part of the Tidyverse, so you probably already have it installed.

Let's use that to extract the median income for counties in the state of Massachusetts.  \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nmass_med_inc <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\", \n  variables = c(median_income = \"B06011_001\"), \n  state = \"MA\", \n  year = 2021\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    lower_90 = estimate - moe,\n    upper_90 = estimate + moe \n  ) |>\n  clean_names() |>\n  mutate(name = str_replace_all(name, \" County, Massachusetts\", \"\")) |>\n  select(name, estimate, lower_90, upper_90)\n\nglimpse(mass_med_inc)\n```\n\nWe can select the county name, median income estimate and the upper and lower confidence intervals and put those in a table. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: bad_table\nkable(mass_med_inc)\n```\n\nBut this is not very compelling. So instead, we can plot confidence intervals with ggplot using a combination of `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_point()`. \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nmass_med_inc |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = estimate, y = reorder(name, estimate))) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower_90, xmax = upper_90)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 2) +\n  labs(title = \"Household income by county in Massachusetts\",\n       subtitle = \"2017-2021 American Community Survey\",\n       y = \"\",\n       x = \"Median Income\", \n       caption = \"ACS estimate (bars represent 90% confidence intervals)\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\nThis conveys a lot more information relative to a table."},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"highlight-style":"atom-one","output-file":"module-6.22.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
